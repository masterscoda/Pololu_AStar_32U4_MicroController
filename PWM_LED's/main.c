Task 1: Use PWM to control the brightness. Allow user to press button A to increase brightness in external LED
Task 2: Use PMW to control blink rate. Allow user to press button C to control blink rate of external LED.
Task 3: Blink built in LED, at a rate of .5 Hz (ON at 1 sec, OFF at 1 sec, â€¦) in main loop using interupts
Task 4: Blink built in LED, at a rate of 2 Hz (ON at 250 ms, OFF at 500 ms, ...) in ISR.
